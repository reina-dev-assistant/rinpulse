/**
 * Port of HuaweiWorkoutSyncManager. GB drives callbacks through a request queue; here each step is a suspend
 * call with the same order and the same retry rules:
 *
 *  1. WorkoutCount (17/07) for the window. An error answer or a count that does not match the list asks twice
 *     for each half of the window instead (at most [MAX_SMALLER_TIMESLOT_DEPTH] levels deep).
 *  2. Per workout, in workout number order: Totals (17/08), Data (17/0A), Pace (17/0C), SwimSegments (17/0E),
 *     SpO2 (17/14), Sections (17/16), then the GPS file (`<n>_gps.bin`, service 2C or 0A).
 *  3. Every request that can answer with an error is repeated up to [MAX_RETRIES] times, then skipped and the
 *     workout is flagged `missingData` (GB shows a toast).
 *  4. A part request (data, pace, swim, SpO2, sections, GPS file) that gets no answer at all is a lost frame, not a dead link:
 *     over LE on Android 14+ the stack discards a 514-byte notification, so a reply longer than 512 bytes (the Band 11 Pro's
 *     first WorkoutData frame, JRG-337) never arrives. The frame is skipped without a retry (the watch would send the same
 *     length again), the workout is flagged `missingData`, and [MAX_LOST_FRAMES] lost frames in a row end that part. When
 *     any frame was lost a cheap request (the totals again) tells a dead link from a lost frame: no answer means the link is
 *     gone and the timeout aborts the sync as in GB, the workout kept as incomplete.
 *
 * Unlike GB the workout is not written to the database until its parts are downloaded, and the sync keeps going
 * after a workout whose totals could not be read. A workout cut short by a timeout is stored as incomplete and
 * fetched again next sync.
