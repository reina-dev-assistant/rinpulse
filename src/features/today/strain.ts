/**
 * Daily strain, computed by JoyoFit from the watch's stored heart rate (the watch has no such number).
 *
 * Load is Edwards' summated-heart-rate-zone TRIMP (Edwards 1993): minutes in 50-60 / 60-70 / 70-80 / 80-90 / 90-100 % of
 * maximum heart rate count 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 times. Strain maps that load onto 0..21 with `21 * (1 - e^(-TRIMP / 250))`,
 * so easy minutes add a lot early in the day and the top is hard to reach. The 0..21 range copies the idea of WHOOP's
 * strain scale; the curve and its constant are JoyoFit's own and are not WHOOP's model. An hour of brisk walking
 * (zone 2, TRIMP 120) is about 8; an hour of steady running (zone 3, 180) about 11; two hard hours (480) about 18.
 *
 * The zones here are a fixed definition, not the person's heart-rate zones (`@/features/hrzones`): Edwards' method is defined on
 * percent of maximum heart rate, so strain, the strain-based load, the intensity minutes and every figure built on them take
 * the maximum heart rate (the person's own entry or 220 - age) and nothing else. Heart-rate reserve, LTHR or hand-edited limits
 * never reach this file; they only drive zone time, coaching and the watch (docs/hr-zones.md, "What the zones do not change").
